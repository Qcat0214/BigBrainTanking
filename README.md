# BigBrainTanking
Addon is still work in progress, but core features are implemented.

## Core features
Automatic salvation removal
Announcements (Interrupts, Misses, Resists, Activation for key abilities)
Soon
Custom messages for announcements
Detailed announcements
Support for items (Lifegiving Gem, etc)
Suggestions to what should be added are welcome in the comments.

## Supported Languages
Since the combat logs have no spell ID in classic, the ability names need to be known for specific languages. Therefore translations for the abilities are required for it to work.

New translations are welcome, please look into the "Locales/BigBrainTanking-enUS.lua" file if you would like to contribute.

### Currently supported
English
